        "# 1 - Scaled Dot Product Attention [8 points]\n",
        "The attention mechanism describes a recent new group of layers in neural networks that has attracted a lot of interest in the past few years, especially in sequence tasks. Here we use the following definition: *the attention mechanism describes a weighted average of (sequence) elements with the weights dynamically computed based on an input query and elements’ keys.* In other words, we want to dynamically decide on which inputs we want to “attend” more than others based on their values. In particular, an attention mechanism has usually **4 parts** we need to specify:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Query**: The query is a feature vector that describes what we are looking for in the sequence, i.e. what would we maybe want to pay attention to.\n",
        "*   **Keys**: For each input element, we have a key which is again a feature vector. This feature vector roughly describes what the element is “offering”, or when it might be important. The keys should be designed such that we can identify the elements we want to pay attention to based on the query.\n",
        "*   **Values**: For each input element, we also have a value vector. This feature vector is the one we want to average over.\n",
        "*   **Score function**: To rate which elements we want to pay attention to, we need to specify a score function $f_{attn}$. The score function takes the query and a key as input, and output the score/attention weight of the query-key pair. It is usually implemented by simple similarity metrics like a dot product, or a small MLP.\n",
        "\n",
        "The weights of the average are calculated by a softmax over all score function outputs. Hence, we assign those value vectors a higher weight whose corresponding key is most similar to the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "The attention applied inside the [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) architecture is called self-attention. In self-attention, each sequence element provides a key, value, and query. For each element, we perform an attention layer where based on its query, we check the similarity of the all sequence elements’ keys, and returned a different, averaged value vector for each element.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core concept behind self-attention is the scaled dot product attention. The dot product attention takes as input a set of queries $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d_k}$, keys $K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d_k}$ and values $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d_v}$ where $T$ is the sequence length, and $d_k$ and $d_v$ are the hidden dimensionality for queries/keys and values respectively.\n",
        "The attention value from element $i$ to $j$ is based on its similarity of the query $Q_i$ and key $K_j$, using the dot product as the similarity metric. Mathmatically:\n",
        "\n",

        "Within the forward pass, we wrap the transformer in a `no_grad` to ensure no gradients are calculated over this part of the model. The transformer actually returns the embeddings for the whole sequence as well as a *pooled* output. The [documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html#transformers.BertModel) states that the pooled output is \"usually not a good summary of the semantic content of the input, you’re often better with averaging or pooling the sequence of hidden-states for the whole input sequence\", hence we will not be using it.\n",
        "The rest of the forward pass is the standard implementation of a recurrent model, where we take the hidden state over the final time-step, and pass it through a linear layer to get our predictions.\n",
